# Meteor Hunt

A [Product Hunt](http://www.producthunt.com/apps/ios) clone built in an attempt to clone [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/)'s Angular directives to [Meteor Blaze](https://www.meteor.com/blaze). **VERY INCOMPLETE!**

## Why?
[Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/) is probably the most comprehensive, polished, cross-platform mobile framework available. But unfortunately a large portion of its functionality comes from Angular directives. I'm not a fan of trying to force-fit Angular into Meteor, so I wanted to see if I could rewrite Ionic specifically for Meteor. [Here's a quick blog post]() I wrote about the similarities between Angular directives and Meteor Templates.
